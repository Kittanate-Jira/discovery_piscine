This rule is VERY IMPORTANT. 
The fixed-top navbar is 56px high. This padding-top on the body 
prevents the content of your sections from being hidden underneath the navbar.

/* This adds some vertical space when you jump to a section.
The 'scroll-margin-top' property is the modern way to handle offsets for fixed headers.
It ensures that when you click a nav link (e.g., "About"), the section title isn't
glued to the bottom of the fixed navbar.
